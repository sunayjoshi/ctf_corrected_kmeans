First make a directory called data at the root of the repo. Then copy ribosome_images_centered.npy and ribosome_angles_centered.npy into data/

To run the Benchmark Algorithm (no CTF-correction), run ./produce_data_ctf_old ./make_plots_ctf_old

To run the Clean Centers Algorithm (CTF-correction with oracle initialization), run ./produce_data_ctf_clean ./make_plots_ctf_clean

To run the Wiener Filtered Centers Algorithm (CTF-correction with Wiener Filtered initialization), run ./produce_data_ctf_wf ./make_plots_ctf_wf
